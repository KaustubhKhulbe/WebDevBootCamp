     <p>Hey! I'm Kaustubh and I'm a passionate student of robotics.
          I've worked with advanced robotics and have worked with
          <em>Kotlin, Java, Python, JS, html, and CSS</em>. I have worked on 
          projects ranging from geometries of four bar linkages, trajectory 
          generation with non linear solvers such as <strong>drake</strong>,
          and counterbalancing pneumatic systems. I have developed <em>Arduino</em>
          curriculums for nearby middles schools and have taught them. In addition,
          I am currently helping bring out Advanced <em>Arduino</em> curriciulums, <em>FLL</em> curriculums,
          and more!
